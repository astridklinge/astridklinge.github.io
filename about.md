Some information about me!

Trained as a zoologist (specialising in Evolutionary Biology and animal locomotion) in Jena, I turned to hearing research for my doctoral training in Oldenburg. There I started out with behavioural experiments in gerbils before I got interested in the question of how sound is processed along the auditory pathway. With a grant from the German Research Foundation I then moved to Oxford to the lab of Prof. Andy King to conduct further neurophysiological experiments in ferrets as a post-doc. Since 2016 I am back in Germany, now in the town of GÃ¶ttingen, to start a post-doc position in the lab of Prof. Tobias Moser.
Apart from being a neuroscientist I am a mother of two gorgeous children I wouldn't want to miss in the world.
